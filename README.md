## Features selection

**Feature selection** – also known as **variable selection**, **attribute selection**, or
**variable subset selection** – is a method used to select a subset of features (variables,
dimensions) from an initial dataset. 

Feature selection is a key step in the process of building machine learning models and 
can have a huge impact on the performance of a model. Using correct and relevant features as 
the input to your model can also reduce the chance of overfitting, because having more relevant 
features reduces the opportunity of a model to use noisy features that don't add signal as input. 

Lastly, having less input features decreases the amount of time that it will take to train a
model.
